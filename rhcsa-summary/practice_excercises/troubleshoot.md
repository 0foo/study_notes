**27.** Fix the web server on server1 and make sure all files are accessible. Do not make any changes to the web server configuration files. Ensure it's accessible from server2 and the client browser.

#### **Solution to Task 27**
Ok, this is a long one. First, we need to check the web server and see what's going on:
```
systemctl status httpd
```
We see something similar to the following:
```
Ã— httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server

```
Ok, we can see here that the it had `(13)Permission denied`, and could not bind to port 85. So, we know the webserver is on port 85, and it's having a permissions issue. Port 85 is a reserved port, and SELinux isn't going to let us bind to that port. Let's get some tools installed to troubleshoot:
```
dnf install -y policycore* setrouble*
```
Now that we have our tools installed, let's try to start it again and see what our logs tell us:
```
systemctl start httpd
grep httpd /var/log/messages
```
Oh man, look at all that gold...
```

```
If we read through all of that, we can see a couple of things going on there. First, it tells us that SELinux is preventing httpd from binding to the port, and then tells us if we want even more detail, we can run `sealert -l d28fbbf2-b7c7-4a6d-a677-7b498dc14c8c`. We don't need to do that, since there's enough info to get going with. Looking further down, it gives us a couple of suggestions on how to fix it. First, we can change the port type by running `semanage port -a -t PORT_TYPE -p tcp 85` and specifying the port type, *OR...* we can create a custom policy by running `ausearch -c 'httpd' --raw | audit2allow -M my-httpd` and then follow it with `semodule -X 300 -i my-httpd.pp`. We're going to choose the latter:
```
ausearch -c 'httpd' --raw | audit2allow -M my-httpd
semodule -X 300 -i my-httpd.pp
```
Now try starting the service again:
```
systemctl start httpd
```
Alright! It works!

Next, we're going to check the files locally:
```
ls -la /var/www/html

total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root  57 Feb  7 10:46 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root  33 Feb  1 08:40 ..

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 168 Feb  1 08:43 file2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  32 Feb  1 08:43 file3
```
Okay, we have three files we need to hit here. Let's give it a shot:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:85/file1

RHCSA is Awesome!
```
So far, so good.
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:85/file2

Still doing alright... Let's check the last one.
```

Damn! We were so close...

Ok, let's see if we can figure out what's going on here. Back to the logs...
```
grep httpd /var/log/messages

```
Ok, just like last time, it's showing us what's going on here and giving suggestions. SELinux is preventing httpd from getattr access to the file. It suggests we can either `restorecon` the file, or run `semanage fcontext -a -t FILE_TYPE '/var/www/html/file3'` to change the label altogether. Let's take a look at the directory:
```
ls -laZ /var/www/html

drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0      57 Feb  7 10:46 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0      33 Feb  1 08:40 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0  18 Feb  1 08:42 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 168 Feb  1 08:43 file2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0            32 Feb  1 08:43 file3
```
And we can see that file3 has a different label from the other two. Let's try the `restorecon`:
```
restorecon /var/www/html/file3
```
And check the directory again:
```
ls -laZ /var/www/html

drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0      57 Feb  7 10:46 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0      33 Feb  1 08:40 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0  18 Feb  1 08:42 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 168 Feb  1 08:43 file2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0  32 Feb  1 08:43 file3
```
Alright, it's looking better! Now let's try to curl it:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:85/file3

This file is totally messed up!
```
Success!!! Alright, last thing is to fix the firewall so external clients can reach it:
```
firewall-cmd --add-port=85/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```
