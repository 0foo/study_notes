## Dynamic Programming
* basically caching answers via memoization or tabulation to save time
* Dynamic programming is all about ordering your computations in a way that avoids recalculating duplicate work. 
  You have a main problem (the root of your tree of subproblems), and subproblems (subtrees). 
  The subproblems typically repeat and overlap.


### Top Down Dynamic Programming
* divide & conquer  + memoization

###  Bottom Up Dynamic programming
* iterative + tabulation
