## Searching

#### Linear/BruteForce search


#### Binary search


#### BFS
* Uses a queue-> FIFO

#### DFS
* Uses a stack-> LIFO
* Can use the call stack in place of an code stack
    * this is recursive solution
    * Instead of having an incode stack, can just add recursive calls to the call stack
* Or can use an actual stack in the code     


#### To Know
* Be able to implement all of these without hesitation
