## Handy Equations

* Sum integers 1 to n
    * Also: (x) + ( x + 1 ) + (x + 2)
    * Simplified to sum of natural integers: `1 + 2 + 3..+ n` 
    * these both become `n ( n + 1 ) / 2`
    * also (n^2 / 2) + (n / 2)
    * this is a time complexity of n ^ 2 as n gets large, in asymptotic analysis
  

* Logarithms: don't forget logn2 = N 
    * same as: 2 ^ X = N
    * x = 3
    * typically base 2 is inferred in big O
  
* n + n/2 + n/4 + n + ... + 1: This is roughly 2n
  * this is basically O(n) in big O as the constant cancels out


* N^2/2 is a big O of O(n^2) as the constant cancels
