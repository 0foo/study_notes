#### Modulus
* You can check whether one number is divisible by anotherâ€”if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y.
* You can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. 
    * For example, x % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10).
    * Similarly x % 100 yields the last two digits.
* Can check if number even or odd by using (n % 2) = 0 for even
* Can get 1 in x chances. i.e. 1 in 5 or i in 2
    *  `len([i for i in range(0,100) if(i%5==0)])` This is eq to 20, or 1 in 5, or 20%
    *  `len([i for i in range(0,100) if(i%2==0)])` This is eq to 50, or 1 in 2, or 50%

#### Get digits from back of integer
* % is modulus
* x = 1794
* x % 10 = 4
* x % 100 = 94
* etc

#### Get digits from front of integer
* //  is integer division
* x = 1794
* x // 1000 = 1
* x // 100 = 17
* etc

#### Palindrom Integer
* this is a great problem to try and view the solution to understand integer numerics



#### To Know
* How get each character of a number by arithemetic, i.e. pop off the front and pop off the back with math
* Identify a palindrome
