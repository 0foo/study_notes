### This is whole class of problems:
* Combinations meeting a condition
* finding number of ways to get all of the the subarrays (k) elements meeting a condition (n). 
* can request to return the:
  1. count of (k) 
  2. list of all of (k)
  3. smallest or largest (k)
    
* ex:
    * condition: sum of elements of subarray =/</> (n)
    * condition: size/length of subarray =/</> (n)
    * knapsack has two conditions:
            * conditionA(n1): weight: element values < (n)
            * conditionB(n2): max(value)
    * coin change problem (Minimum Number of Coins (smalles length from all of k) Required to Meet an Amount (n)):
        * condition: sum of elements = (n)
        * return smallest length of the subarrays (k)
    * binomial coefficient(note: this is the statistics term for this type of problem)
