internal commands: part of shell itself
external commands: a file on the path
use type to see if command is internal or external and if an alias or not

can use type in combination with which to find out info about a command



1. Programmable completion for bash is provided in the bash-completion module. To install this module:
    ```shell
    sudo dnf install bash-completion
    ```

1. Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

    * Common commands and their options, as well as vim usage, are shown below:
        * cp
            * cp -R : recursively copies everything 
            * cp -a : archive mode copies all permissions and everything exactly the same
            * tip: add a slash after copy to not create the new folder and get error message
                * cp /etc/hosts /tmp/ vs cp /etc/hosts /tmp

        * file <filename>
            * identifies what type of file it is
