On the RHCSA exam, you are likely to configure a couple of services. It is a
good idea to read through the exam questions, identify the services that need to be
enabled, and enable them all at once to make sure that they are started automatically
when you restart. This prevents your being so focused on configuring the service that
you completely forget to enable it as well.
