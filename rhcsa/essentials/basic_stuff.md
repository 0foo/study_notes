### Command redirection

1. Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)
	* essentially change the output/input from monitor/keyboard

    * The default locations for input, output, and error are referred to as standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr). 
		* These are known as streams and streams are treated like files (like almost everything on linux)
		* The file descriptors for the streams are:
			* file descriptor 0: stdin -> default is keyboard
			* file descriptor 1: stdout -> default is monitor
			* file descriptor 2: stderr
		* Redirection symbols:
			* < or 0<
			* > or 1>
			* 2>
    
    * Standard input redirection can be done to have a command read the required information from an alternative source, such as a file, instead of the keyboard. For example:
        ```shell
        cat < /etc/cron.allow 
        ```

    * Standard output redirection sends the output generated by a command to an alternative destination, such as a file. For example:
        ```shell
        ll > ll.out
        ```

    * Standard error redirection sends the error output generated by a command to an alternative destination, such as a file. For example: 
        ```shell
        echo test 2> outerr.out
        ```

    * Instead of > to create or overwrite, >> can be used to append to a file.

    * To redirect both stdout and stderror to the same file:
        ```shell
        echo test >> result.txt 2>&1
        ```

	* This command will direct stdout to a file called capture.txt and stderr to a file called error.txt:
		```shell
		/error.sh 1> capture.txt 2> error.txt
        		```
    * Pipes
        * redirect output of one command to another command
        * `cat somefile.txt | grep someword`

### Linux everything is a file

* Everything in linux is a file (or at least trys to be)
    * can be accessed with read() and write()
    * hardware can be accessed via device files in /dev
    * streams are files
    * network sockets are files


* Bash cmpletion
    * Can hit tab twice on incomplete commands or filenames and cli will autocmplete ghe command or file



### Shell types
* Environment files
    * login shells:
        * When ssh'ing into systems, when logging in the FIRST TIME to system
        * /etc/profile: used to configure ALL login shells
        * ~/.profile, /.bash_profile, /etc/zprofile, ~/.zprofile
    * non-login shells:
        * a subshell, terminal app, script
        * a terminal typically creates a subshell when it opens
            * the terminal program decides though whether to be login shell or not
            * mac osx is login shell though
        * /etc/bashrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc 
    * interactive vs non-interactive
        * interactive: you will input commands
        * non-interactive: a script or command passed which opens a new shell environment
        * interactive login shells: standard SSH cnxxn
        * non interactive login shell: running a local script on remote computer via ssh
    * identify if in login shell
        ```shell
            prompt> echo $0
            -bash # "-" is the first character. Therefore, this is a login shell.

            prompt> echo $0
            bash # "-" is NOT the first character. This is NOT a login shell.
        ```


### Login files
* login files:
    * /etc/motd: after login
    * /etc/issues: before login, good for specifying login issues or security concerns


### Reset root password if forget
* Very important, on the RHCSA

### General info
* if a command is aliased can use a forward slash to ignore the alias
    * ie if ls is aliased to ls -la use \ls to use the original command

### History
* `history`: gives command history
    * cntr + r
    * -c clears current history, -w clears ALL history(can also delete ~/.bash_history)
    * located in ~/.bash_history (all commands kept in memory until shell closed then history is written)


## Documentation

* Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in `/usr/share/doc`
    * man command, <command> --help, info/pinfo
        * see command list above
    * /usr/share/docs
        * some services put very useful info here

    * The *man* command can be used to view help for a command. To search for a command based on a keyword the *apropros* command or *man* with the -k option can be used. The *mandb* command is used to build the man database.

    * To search for a command based on a keyword in occurring in its man page:
        ```shell
        man -k <keyword>
        ```

    * The *whatis* command can be used to search for a command in the man database for a short description.

    * The *info* command provides more detailed information than the *man* command. 

    * The `/usr/share/doc` directory contains documentation for all installed packages under sub-directories that match package names followed by their version.
