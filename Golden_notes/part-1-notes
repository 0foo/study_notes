Windows processes
- EProcess structure
- Windows organizes active processes using a doubly linked list pointed to by PsActiveProcessHead
- – Rootkits can unlink entries to hide processes from tools on the running system
– Does not interrupt process execution because the CPU scheduler is thread-based
- more DKOM and unlinking


Identifying system processes
- list of legit system processes
- visualization of clean systems

- to see if unlinked in one but not another
