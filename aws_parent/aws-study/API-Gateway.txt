API Gateway
-----

Fully managed API service
	* publish, maintain, monitor, secure API's at any scale
	* can connect to many other AWS services

* can cache for you to increase performance
* Expose HTTP endpoints to define a restful API
* is serverless
* can send each endpoint to a different target
* API keys to track/control use
* throttle requests to prevent attacks/usage plans
* cloudwatch for monitoring
* multi-version of API
* scale effortlessly, low cost, 

Configure
* define an API container
* Define resources and nested resources(url paths)
* For each resource 
	* HTTP verb (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
	* set security 
	* choose target 
	* set request/response transformatoin
* deploy API gateway to a stage(dev, prod, QA, etc)
* Domain
	* uses API gateway domain by default 
	* can use a custom domain
* Can use AWS certificate manager(free SSL/TSL certs)

API GW caching 
	* caches endpoint response
	* reduces number of calls made to endpoint
	* improve latency of the requests to you API
	* caches with a TTL (in seconds)
	* API will look up from the cache instead of making request to your endpoing

API means (applicatiom programming interface)
Rest API 
	* Representation State Transfer
	* simple
	* json
SOAP Api's
	* Simple Object Access Protocol
	* not simple 
	* uses xml

CORS
	* same origin policy
		* web browswer permits one file to access another file but only if both have the same origin domain
		* done to prevent cross site scripting attacks
		* Browser make an HTTP OPTIONS call (OPTIONS is another http verb like GET)
		* Server returns response with allowed domains to get this URL
		* "Origin policy cannot be read at the remote resource" 
			* need to enable CORS


Can import APIs
	* API gateway import feature
	* swagger(open API) spec v2.0
	* can update, merge, create, etc

API throttling
	* api gateway default 10,000 QPS
	* max concurrent requests(i.e. simoultanous requests) is 5,000 concurrent requests across all API's withing an AWS account
	* if violate this will recieve '429 Too Many Request' error
	* Note: if 10000 requests sent all at once will violate the concurrency EVEN if within the one second limit
	* the 10000 must be staggered to not violate the 1 second or the concurrency issues

SOAP service pass through
	* Can configure API gateway as a SOAP service passthrough




MApping templates
-----
The API Gateway mapping templates are used to transform an incoming payload into a different format
API Gateway uses the concept of “models” and “mapping templates” to specify the mapping between the client payload and the server payload.
* A model defines the structure of the incoming payload using JSON Schema. The model is an optional, but not required, piece of API Gateway. By providing a model, you make it easier to define the upcoming mapping template that actually does the transformation between the client and server.
