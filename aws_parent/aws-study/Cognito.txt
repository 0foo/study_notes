Web Identity Federation
---
Lets gives users access to AWS resources after they have successfully authtenticated with a web-based identity provider like Amazon, Google, or Facebook


User authenticates first with web id provider
recieves authentication token (Json Web token)
exchange authentication token for temporary aws access credentials inside AWS
credentials allow them to assume a role



Following authentication, user recieves an authentication code from the third party provider that they can trade for temporary AWS resources

* basically OAUTH


Cognito
	* provides web identity federation
	* sign up/in to your apps
	* acts as identity between your app and Web ID providers, so you don't need to write any additional code
	* Synchronizes user data for multiple devices
	* reccomended for all mobile application AWS services
	* brokers b/t web id to provide credentials which map to an IAM Role allowing access to other requried resources
	* No need to store credentials on user device


User Pools
------
SIGN UP and SIGN IN
user directories used to manage sign up and sign in functionality for web apps/mobile apps
generates JWTs (json web tokesn)
can sign in directly to the user pool or via web id


identity pools
----
create unique identities for your suers and authenticate with web id providers
with an identity can obtain temporary IAM creds


Cognito Sync
-----
Cognito tracks the association between user identity and the devices they sign in from
uses push synchronization to push updates and synchronize data across devices
SNS is used to send a silent push notification when ever data stored in the cloud changes
"Cognito Sync" : Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data. You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend
