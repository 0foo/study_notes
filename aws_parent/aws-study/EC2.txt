ec2 (elastic compute cloud)
----
Individual instances provisioned in AZ's NOT regions
4 pricing types - 
on demand 
	* baseline servers
	* fixed rate by the hour cost
reserved 
	* requires a contract
		* 1 year or 3 year terms
	* standard RI's(up to 75% cheaper) vs convertile RI's(up to 54% cheaper)
		* standard RI's can be modified:	
		    Availability Zone or scope
		    Network platform (EC2-Classic or VPC)
		    Instance size in same instance family
		* convertible can be modified and exchanged
			instance family 
			operating system 
			tenancy
	* scheduled RI's !!!
		* instance time share

spot
	* apps that can be interrupted, flexible start/end times
	* need a lot of compute for cheap(genomics/data crunching)
	* bid whatever price you want 
	* !!! If a spot instance is termiated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for partial hour of usage, however, if you terminate it yourself, 
		you will be charged the full hour

dedicated
	* useful for regulatory requirements/licensing, that don't support multi-tenant virtualization
	* purchased on demand, or reserved (up to 70% off on demand price)
	* some licenses are server bound and attach to a server, so you don't want that server to change

User Data
	* can run bash scripts when instance is first created

Instance Meta Data
	* can get a bunch of info about a running instance that AWS has stored
	* must visit http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data


ec2 instance types(note only need this for professional, not associate cert.)
Fight Dr McPx
F - FPGA - field programmable gate array - genomics, financial analytics, real time video processing, big data crunching
I - IOPS - high speed storage (no sql dbs, data warehousing)
G - Graphics - video encoding/3d app streaming
H - High disk throughput - (map/reduce, distributed file systems)
T - cheap general purpose(thrifty) - web servers, small DBs
D - Density - dense storage - file systems, data warehousing, hadoop
R - Ram - memory intensive (high memory intensive apps/db's)
M - main choice for general purpose apps - application servers
C - Compute/CPU - CPU intensive Apps/DB's
P - Pics(graphics) - machine learning/crypto mining
X - Xtreme memory - SAP Hana/Apache Spark/etc.


Autoscaling group
----
unhealthy instances will be terminated and a new one launched
