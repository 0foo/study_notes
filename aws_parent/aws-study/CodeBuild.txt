Fully managed build service

AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, patch, update, and manage your own build servers and software. There is no software to install or manage.
Continuous scaling

AWS CodeBuild scales up and down automatically to meet your build volume. It immediately processes each build you submit and can run separate builds concurrently, which means your builds are not left waiting in a queue.
Pay as you go

With AWS CodeBuild, you are charged based on the number of minutes it takes to complete your build. This means you no longer have to worry about paying for idle build server capacity.
Extensible

You can bring your own build tools and programming runtimes to use with AWS CodeBuild by creating customized build environments in addition to the prepackaged build tools and runtimes supported by CodeBuild.
Enables continuous integration and delivery

AWS CodeBuild belongs to a family of AWS Code Services, which you can use to create complete, automated software release workflows for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). You can also integrate CodeBuild into your existing CI/CD workflow. For example, you can use CodeBuild as a worker node for your existing Jenkins server setup for distributed builds.
Secure

With AWS CodeBuild, your build artifacts are encrypted with customer-specific keys that are managed by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). CodeBuild is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), so you can assign user-specific permissions to your build projects.
