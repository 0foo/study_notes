* ECS anywhere
    * easily run containers on customer managed on prem hard ware
    * can deploy native ECS tasks in any environment
    * the hosts communicate with ECS control plane in AWS
    * ECS container agent and SSM agent need to be installed on the host(will register with AWS cloud)
    * specify the "External" launch type for our services and tasks in ECS on AWS
    * must have a stable connection to AWS (region with your ECS control plane)
    * useful for compliance, reduced latency
    * run apps closer to their on prem services


* EKS anywhere
    * create/operate kubernetes cluster operated outside AWS
    * use AWS EKS distro (AWS bundled release of EKS)
    * This works without any connection to AWS!
    * can use EKS connector to connect the on prem EKS to AWS cloud and use EKS console on prem.

    * Managing your own Kubernetes cluster involves maintaining multiple tools (like kubeadm, Helm, or others), dealing with compatibility issues, and ensuring all components (e.g., etcd, networking, etc.) are configured correctly.
        * EKS-A abstracts much of this complexity.
        * ALLOWS INTEGRATION WITH other AWS services like cloudwatch, systems manager, etc.
        * many third-party monitoring, logging, and security tools are integrated already
        * simplifies tasks like cluster upgrades and backup management, which can be complex in self-managed environments.
        * EKS Anywhere ships with pre-configured, validated networking, storage, and observability components.
