* A Virtual Private Gateway (VPG), often abbreviated as VGW, is an AWS-managed network gateway that enables connectivity between your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and external networks. 

It is primarily used for:
* setting up Site-to-Site VPN connections
* integrating with AWS Direct Connect.
    * it's what the VIF associates with to connect to the VPC

Supports both:

    Dynamic routing: Uses BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for route propagation.
    Static routing: Manually defined routes.
