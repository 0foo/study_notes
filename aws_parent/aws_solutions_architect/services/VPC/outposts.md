#### Hybrid cloud
* business that have on-prem infra alongside a cloud infra
* will have two ways of dealing with IT systems, skillsets, API,etc.
* AWS created outposts


#### outpost
* AWS will come setup and manage "Outpost racks" at your local business
    * will have on-prem infra with AWS services setup
    * same AWS infra tools/services but on prem

* can use same skills/knowledge base and still have on-prem benefits

* Tradeoff: 
    * you are responsible for physical security because that rack is on your local system
    * Only a subset of AWS services work on outpost local on-prem

* Benefits: 
    * speed
    * migrations
    * security of data because it's local
    * low latency


* to connect to your aws services from dash 
    * can either use an outposts link
    * or do a sync to the cloud
