* 4 kinds(in order of release date)


* Classic
    * old generation
    * HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL(secure TCP)
    * Health checks can be L7 via HTTP or layer 4 via TCP
    * only one SSL certificate allowed(must use multiple CLB for multiple)

    * health checks at the target group level
    * Can load balance to multiple services/applications on the same machine which is a great fit for containers
        * dynamic port mapping
    * can write routing rules to LB traffic to in detail:  path, headers, query string, etc.
        * ex: one route for search, and one for login
    * can integrate it directly with various services
        * EC2
        * ECS on EC2
        * ECS on Fargate
        * AWS Global Accelerator
        * AWS WAF
        * S3 (Static Website Hosting)
        * API Gateway (as an HTTP backend)
        * Lambda


* Network LB
    * TCP, TLS(secure TCP), UDP
    * handle millions of RPS
    * this is the speed LB, very high performance
    * less latency than ALB also
    * has one static IP per AZ
    * supports assigning an Elastic IP-helpful for whitelisting an IP
    * not included in AWS free tier
    * target groups: EC2 instance, or an Appliation Load Balancer
    * can only send traffic to privte ips


* Gateway LB
    * operates at layer 3(network)-IP protocol
    * deploy scale/manage 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
    * Firewalls, intrusion detection, deep packet inspection, payload manipulation
    * operates on IP packets (layer 3)
    * transparent exit/entry
    * distribute to applicances
    * Uses Geneve protocol on port 6081
    * allows you to spin up a bunch of parallel traffic analyzer tools and get the traffic Load Balanced between them
    * After traffic analysis the applicancds send the data back to LB which forwards to the application
    * target groups: EC2, or private IPs

* target groups
    * EC2 instances: http
    * ECS tasks: http
    * Lambda -> http request tranlated into json
    * any private ip address: http

* DNS
    * all load balancers have a DNS url upon creation
    * AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) provides a unique zonal DNS name for each availability zone (AZ) where it is deployed. These zonal DNS names allow clients to directly access specific load balancer nodes in a particular AZ, which is useful for certain advanced networking scenarios
    * Normal regional url: <load-balancer-name>-<hash>.<region>.elb.amazonaws.com
    * Zonal url: <AZ>.<load-balancer-name>-<hash>.<region>.elb.amazonaws.com
    * This has a url for each AZ in the LB and has a url for the LB in general
    
* cross zone load Balancing
    * LB disgtributes traffic evenly across all registered instances in ALL AZs
    * i.e. if have two instances i one AZ and 8 in another AZ the traffic will STILL be distributed even across all 10 instances
        * i.e. 10% of traffic to each instance no matter the AZ
    * always on (cant be disabled in ALB, must be enabled in all the rest)



* sticky session
    * the client always communicates with the same instance
    * makes sure user doens;t lose session data (i.e. if cookie in memory or somegthing)
    * enabling this, may bring imabalance to the load over back end EC2 instances


* Routing algorithms
    * Least Outstanding Request
        * instance with lowest number or pending/unfinished requests
        * CLB and ALB have
    * Round robin
        * just cyclers thru
        * ALB, CLB
    
    * Flow Hash
        * take a bunch of data from the request packet and generate a hash and route based on that hash
        * with this its permanantly sticky




#### ways to connect to load balancers
Yes, among the AWS load balancers, Network Load Balancers (NLBs) can be internet-facing and associated with Elastic IPs (EIPs). However, Application Load Balancers (ALBs) and Gateway Load Balancers (GWLBs) do not directly support Elastic IPs.

Hereâ€™s how Elastic IPs work with different load balancer types:

1. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
* Supports Elastic IPs: 
* For each subnet where you deploy an NLB, you can associate a specific Elastic IP (EIP). This makes the NLB's public-facing IP address static, which is ideal for predictable client-side configurations.
* Internet-Facing:
* NLBs can be configured as internet-facing to expose services to the public internet.
* Use Case:
* Ideal for applications requiring low latency, high throughput, and static IPs (e.g., FTP, gaming, VoIP).

Steps to Configure an Internet-Facing NLB with EIP:
* Create an NLB with internet-facing scheme.
* Add listeners for the required ports (e.g., 21 for FTP).
* Associate an EIP for each public subnet used by the NLB.

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* Does Not Support Elastic IPs:
* ALBs are designed to route traffic using DNS-based endpoints rather than static IPs. They use dynamic public IPs managed by AWS.
* Internet-Facing:
* ALBs can still be configured as internet-facing but rely on AWS DNS names (e.g., abc123.elb.amazonaws.com) instead of static IPs.
* Use Case:
* Best suited for HTTP/HTTPS workloads with advanced Layer 7 routing features.

Workaround for Static IPs with ALB:
* Use a Static IP Proxy:
* Deploy an NLB in front of the ALB and associate EIPs with the NLB. The NLB forwards traffic to the ALB.
* Use AWS Global Accelerator:
* Provides static IPs that route traffic to the ALB via a global edge network.

3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
* Does Not Support Elastic IPs:
* GWLB is designed for traffic inspection and routing through virtual appliances, not for public internet-facing use.
* Use Case:
* Ideal for deploying and managing third-party virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems).

Workaround for Public Traffic with GWLB:
* Use an NLB with EIP in front of the GWLB for public-facing traffic.

4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
* Supports Elastic IPs:
* For each subnet where you deploy a CLB, you can associate an EIP.
* Internet-Facing:
* CLBs can be internet-facing and use EIPs for static IP configuration.
* Use Case:
* Legacy applications still relying on CLBs for Layer 4 and basic Layer 7 routing.

Summary of Elastic IP Compatibility
Network Load Balancer (NLB): Supports Elastic IPs and can be internet-facing, ideal for low latency and static IP needs.
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Does not support Elastic IPs but can be internet-facing with advanced routing for HTTP/HTTPS.
Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): Does not support Elastic IPs and is not internet-facing, used for traffic inspection.
Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Supports Elastic IPs and can be internet-facing for legacy workloads.

Conclusion
* If you need static IPs with internet-facing capability, the best choice is the Network Load Balancer (NLB) or Classic Load Balancer (CLB).
* For ALBs or GWLBs, workarounds like pairing with an NLB or AWS Global Accelerator can provide static IP functionality.
