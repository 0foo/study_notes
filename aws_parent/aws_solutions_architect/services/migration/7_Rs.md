* 1. Rehost ("Lift & Shift")  
  Move the application as-is to the cloud without significant changes. Quickest, often automated with tools like AWS Migration Hub or Server Migration Service (SMS).

* 2. Replatform ("Lift, Tinker & Shift")  
  Make minimal changes (e.g., change the OS, switch databases, or move to managed services like RDS instead of self-hosted MySQL).

* 3. Repurchase ("Drop & Shop")  
  Replace the app with a SaaS solution. For example, move from a self-hosted CRM to Salesforce or Workday.

* 4. Refactor / Re-architect  
  Redesign the application to be cloud-native (e.g., move from monolith to microservices, use serverless or containers). Usually the most effort, but unlocks max cloud benefits.

* 5. Retire  
  Decommission unused or obsolete apps. No need to migrate something no one uses anymore!

* 6. Retain ("Revisit")  
  Keep the app as-is, on-premises or in a hybrid setup — at least for now. Often used for compliance or technical constraints.

* 7. Relocate  
  Move entire VMs or infrastructures to the cloud without purchasing new hardware — like VMware Cloud on AWS or AWS Snowball. Faster than rehosting, but keeps your architecture the same.
