The Storage Gateway service is primarily used for attaching infrastructure located in a Data center to the AWS Storage infrastructure. The AWS documentation states that; "You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3." Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a mountable file storage service for EC2, but has no connection to S3 which is an object storage service. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block level storage service for use with Amazon EC2 and again has no connection to S3.
