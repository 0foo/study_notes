Route53.txt

Route 53
------
Amazons DNS service
Can map domain names to:
* EC2 instances
* Load Balancers 
* S3 buckets

Note: under the covers, it's mapping a domain name to an IP of one of the previous

Inside of Route 53 console
	* will create an A record (IP)
	* and alias section of the console will allow you to map that to a certain type of resource


IAM - Identity access manager
----
users, groups, roles, policies

if cred's on an ec2 instance and active, they will override that instances roles if using CLI. 
Delete them in order to use aws cli with the roles of the ec2 instance

Can connect security groups to other security groups i.e. can allow a security group into a port in another security group 

Least Permissions
Add users to groups
Access Key and
Secret Access key only see once

Roles allow you not to use access keys and secret access keys
preferred from security perspective
roles controlled by policies
changing policy on a role takes immediate effect, even on running ec2's 


Principle is who is allowed to access this resource
	* account, user ,ec2, etc.
Service
	* what service
Resource
	* arn of a specific resource
Action
	* the list of policy
Role
	* what the policies can do
ARN(amazon resource name)
	* a specific resource, i.e. a specific s3 bucket, etc.
