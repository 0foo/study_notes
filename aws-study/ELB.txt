 ELB elastic load balancer
----
3 types of ELB - application, network, classic


 
Application Load Balancers
	* load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic
	* operate at Layer 7 and are application aware
	* intelligent and you can create advance web request routing, sending specific requests to specific web servers

Network Load Balancers
	* load balancing TCP traffic 
	* used where extreme performance is required 
	* Operate at Layer 4
	* Millions of QPS while maintaining ultra low latencies

Classic Load Balancers
	* Legacy
	* uses layer 4 or layer 7
	* Layer 7->Load Balance HTTP/HTTPS applications 
	* can use layer 7 specific features: x-forward and sticky sessions
		* note: not as intelligent as application LB
		* just uses those two feature from http
	* use layer 4 for performance

Errors
	* if app stops responding: Load balancer responds with a 504 
	* could be either App or Database

XforwardedFor header
	* ELB has a public IP and forwards to a network of private IP servers
	* Note: load balancer tacks on the public address in the xforwardedfor header
	* if need the public IP, check the xforwardedfor header

root device encryption:
1> take snapshot
2> create AMI
3> deploy encrypted ami
non-root device(attached volumes) can be encrypted using console,cli,api
