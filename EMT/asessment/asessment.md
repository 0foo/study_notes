### Initial assessment

* respiration
    * rate/volume
        * normal adult(12 y.o. and older): 12-20/minute(concern if +-4 in either direction i.e. <8 >24), 
        * elderly: 20-24(decreased tidal volume, therefore must increase rate)
 
        * other ages:
            * Rule of Thumb: "Younger = Faster"
            * Start around 60 breaths/min in neonates, and drop ~10 with each older age group

            * Approximate Respiratory Rates by Age Group:
            * Neonate (0–1 month): 40–60
            * Infant (1–12 months): 30–53
            * Toddler (1–2 years): 22–37
            * Preschooler (3–5 years): 20–28
            * Middle School (6–11 years): 18–25
            * Adolescent & Adult (12+ years): 12–20

            * Mnemonic Pattern:
            * ~40-60 → Neonate
            * ~30-50 → Infant
            * ~20-40 → Toddler
            * ~20-30 → Preschooler
            * ~20-25 → Middle School
            * ~12-20 → Teen/Adult

    * taking rate
        * observed by chest rise and fall
        * chest rist should be 1 inch expansion in outward direction
        * exhalation should take ~ twice as long as inhalation
        * count breaths in a 30 second period and multiply by 2

    * sounds
        * upper airway
            * stridor: object obstruction
            * gurgling: fluid obstruction
            * snoring: tongue obstructing
        * lower airway(asculatation)
            * wheezing: 
                * constriction/narrowing of bronchioles
                * inflammation
            * crackles
                * fluid surrounding/filling alveoli
            * rhonci
                * mucus blocking larger bronchioles
        
    * patient presentaion
        * in respiratory distress
            * using accessory muscles of chest, neck, abdomen
            * uneven breathing
        * level of conciousness/mental status 
        * pain triggers sympathetic nervous system, which increase respiratory rate

    * other considerations
        * if patient is alert but has abnormal numbers for rate/volume
        * if rate/volume is normal but patient presentation is showing other symptoms 
        * can pretend to check radial pulse and count the breaths(knowing you're measuring breaths can cause patients to change their breathing)
* pulse
    * location
        * radial pulse should be assessed in all patients 1 year or older
        * use brachial for patiens 1 year or younger
        * sometime peripheral pulse cannot be obtained so use carotid pulse
        * if patient unresponsive check both carotid and radial at same time
    * heart rate
        * Newborn: ~160 (100–180) 
        * Infant: ~140 (100–160)
        * Toddler: ~130 (90–150)
        * Preschooler: ~120 (80–140)
        * Middle School-age: ~100 (70–120) 
        * Teen/Adult: ~80 (60–100) 
        * Eldery: same as adult but on the lower side
     
    * tachycardia in adult:  >100 
    * serious problems in adult: >130 or <45
    * bradycardia in infant <100
    * note: presentation and injury is important as well, abnormal heart rate may be normal(ex: athletes can have resting rate in the 40's)
    * take pulse: count beats in 30 seconds and multiply by 2
    * weak pulse indicates not enough blood being ejected from left ventricle
        * volume loss
        * heart muscle failure
        * one caveat: could be partially occluded artery due to clot or injury (check other pulse locations)

* skin
    * Skin Color and Possible Problem:
        * Pallor (white): 
            * typically from the sympathetic response triggering Vasoconstriction
                * blood loss, shock, heart attack, fright, fainting(late stages), or emotional distress
            * anemia: 
                * Pallor is due to reduced hemoglobin in skin capillaries, not sympathetic vasoconstriction
                * Skin may appear pale even if perfusion is normal

        * Cyanosis (blue-gray): Inadequate oxygenation or perfusion (shock), inadequate respiration, or heart attack
            * Blue-gray color, or cyanosis. This indicates inadequate oxygenation or poor perfusion.
            * It can indicate conditions such as suffocation, inadequate respirations, hypoxia, hypoxemia, heart attack, or poisoning. 
            * Cyanosis always indicates a serious problem but often is seen very late.

        * Flushing (red): Heat exposure or carbon monoxide poisoning (late)
        * Jaundice (yellow): Liver disease
        * Red color, or flushing: This may be a sign of heat exposure, peripheral vasodilation, or a very late finding in carbon monoxide poisoning.
        * Mottling (gray-blue): Blotchy pattern
            * Mottled skin may be seen in some shock patients or patients with blood pooling in the extremities for a long period of time.

    * Skin Temperature and Possible Problem:
        * Hot: Fever or heat exposure
        * Cool: Poor perfusion (shock) or cold exposure
        * Cold: Extreme cold exposure

    * Skin Condition and Possible Problem:
        * normally skin is dry
        * Wet or moist(diaphoresis): Shock, heat emergency, or diabetic emergency
        * Abnormally dry: Spinal injury, dehydration, heat stroke, poisoning, or hypothyroidism


* capillary refill
    * The time it takes for compressed capillaries to fill up again with blood is called capillary refill time. 
    * To measure capillary refill, press firmly on the skin or nail bed (Figure 11-6a). When you remove your finger, the compressed area will be white (Figure 11-6b). Count the time it takes to return to the original color.
    * When assessed at room temperature, the upper limits of normal capillary refill times are 2 seconds for infants, children, and male adults
    * 3 seconds for females
    * 4 seconds for the elderly
    * In children, capillary refill is considered a more sensitive indicator of early shock, especially when combined with skin signs and mental status.
    * In adults, it's less reliable alone, but a delayed refill in conjunction with thready pulse and altered LOC is highly concerning

* pupils
    * Dilated:
        * Cardiac arrest (pupils will also be fixed)
        * Drug use such as LSD, amphetamines, or cocaine

    * Constricted:
        * Central nervous system disorder
        * Narcotics use

    * Unequal(anisocoria):
        * not a small inequality may just be genetic
        * Stroke
        * Head injury
        * Artificial eye (occasionally a normal finding)
        * Eye drops
        * Eye trauma

    * Nonreactive:
        * Cardiac arrest
        * Brain injury
        * Eye drops
        * Drug intoxication or overdose

* blood pressure
    * systolic - pressure of left ventricle when contracting
    * diastolic - constant pressure in arteries
        * measure of vasoconstriction/dilation
        * note: can decrease if hypovolemic
    * normal adult: less than 120/ less than 80

    * Normal Blood Pressures by Age:
        * Adult:
            * Systolic BP: 120 or less
            * Diastolic BP: 80 or less
        * Adolescent (12–15 years):
            * Systolic BP: 110–131
            * Diastolic BP: 64–83
        * Preadolescent (10–12 years):
            * Systolic BP: 102–120
            * Diastolic BP: 61–80
        * School-aged (6–9 years):
            * Systolic BP: 97–115
            * Diastolic BP: 57–76
        * Preschooler (3–5 years):
            * Systolic BP: 89–112
            * Diastolic BP: 46–72
        * Toddler (1–2 years):
            * Systolic BP: 86–106
            * Diastolic BP: 42–63
        * Infant (1–12 months):
            * Systolic BP: 72–104
            * Diastolic BP: 37–56
        * Neonate (Birth–30 days):
            * Systolic BP: 67–84
            * Diastolic BP: 35–53


    * Hypotension by Age:
        * Adult:
            * Systolic BP: < 90 mmHg
        * Children > 10 years:
            * Systolic BP: < 90 mmHg
        * Children 1–10 years:
            * Systolic BP: < 70 + (2 × age in years)
        * Infants (1–12 months):
            * Systolic BP: < 60 mmHg

    * pulse pressure - difference between systolic and diastolic
        * if pulse pressure < 25% of systolic it's a narrow pulse pressure
        * if pulse pressure > 50% of systolic it's a wide pulse pressure
        * It typically narrows due to systolic dropping
            * A narrow pulse pressure is usually a result of less blood being ejected from the left ventricle because of either volume loss or left ventricular failure, which causes the systolic blood pressure to decrease while peripheral vasoconstriction causes the diastolic blood pressure to remain stable or increase.
    * The blood pressure can decrease because of blood or fluid loss, cardiac pump failure, or blood vessel dilation (the vessel diameter increases in size) or nervous system disorder
    * The abnormally high blood pressure can cause damage to the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart damage and failure, stroke, ruptured blood vessels, and kidney disease.

    * measure blood pressure
        * ascultate with sphygomometer
        * palpate with sphygomometer
    * orthostatic/tilt test
        * supine -> measure blood
        * then stand patient up wait two minutes -> measure blood
        * if heart rate increases by more than 20 and systolic decreases by more than 20
            * positive test
        * if positive->indicates significant loss of blood or fluid volume
        * heart rate is usually best indicator over systolic
        * some beta blockers may prevent heart rate from increasing
        * elderly may give false positive on tilt test when using systolic measurement instead of heart rate
            * one study: 25% of patients over 65 when give false positive using systolic as the metric
        * If the patient has a significant volume loss, he may pass out when moving to a standing position
            * this is also considered a positive test
        
* pulse oximetry
    * clip on fingers
    * gives percentage of hemoglobin with oxygen attached
    * other gases like Carbon monoxide can give a false positive as it preferentially binds to Hemoglobin over oxygen
    * normal pulse ox reading is high 90's: 97% to 100%
    * less than 94%  is possible hypoxia
    * less then 90% is definite hypoxia
    * note: must consider context as well
        * many COPD or Heart failure patients may have less than 90% normally
    * if patient is experiencing->acute coronary syndrom
        * should only recieve oxygen if measurement is less than 90%
* capnography
* glucose
* pain assesment
* temperature
