### Notes

* Thready: The general term for a weak, rapid pulse 
* Clammy: cool and moist
* DKA: Diabetic Ketoacidosis
* LOC: Level of Consciousness 

### General
* Sympathetic nervous system stimulation → SNS
  * Heart rate: Increased (positive chronotropy)
    * Medulla signals via sympathetic fibers → norepinephrine at SA/AV node → β1 stimulation
  * Contractility: Increased (positive inotropy)
    * Improves stroke volume → maintains cardiac output
  * Vascular tone: Increased vasoconstriction and BP
    * NE binds to α1 receptors → Ca²⁺ influx → smooth muscle contraction → ↑ SVR, BP
  * Respiratory rate: Increased (tachypnea)
    * Triggered by CO₂/pH/O₂ receptors and stress via hypothalamus
  * Bronchodilation: β2 stimulation in bronchial smooth muscle
  * Pupils: Dilated (radial muscle contraction)
  * Skin:
    * Color: Pale or ashen from peripheral vasoconstriction
    * Temp: Cool or cold
    * Quality: Clammy from sweat gland activation
  * Mental status: Alert/anxious/restless
  * GI/urinary: ↓ motility and urine output (blood shunted to core)
  * Blood pressure: Elevated or normal early; may fall if compensation fails
  * Pulse pressure: Normal or slightly widened early; narrows as compensation fails
  * Pulse oximetry: Normal or slightly decreased; may fall with worsening perfusion

* Late-stage signs (decompensated shock or failure of SNS)
  * Cyanosis: Critical hypoxemia (lips, fingers, mucosa)
  * Mottled skin: Blood stagnation in capillaries
  * Skin: Cold and clammy
  * Pulses: Weak or absent peripherally
  * Blood pressure: Critically low (SBP < 90 mmHg or unobtainable)
  * Pulse pressure: Narrowed (falling systolic, preserved diastolic)
  * Mental status: Altered or unresponsive
  * Respirations: Irregular or agonal
  * Cap refill: Delayed (>2 seconds)
  * Pupils: Dilated, possibly nonreactive
  * Pulse oximetry: Low (often < 90%), especially with respiratory compromise

### Abstracted Presentations

* Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) Activation
  * Pulse: Rapid (tachycardia), weak
  * Skin color: Pale
  * Skin temperature: Cool or cold
  * Skin condition: Moist/clammy (diaphoresis)
  * Respiratory rate: Increased (tachypnea)
  * Capillary refill: Normal to slightly delayed (1.5–2 seconds)
  * Pupils: Dilated (mydriasis), may be unequal or fixed
  * Blood pressure: Elevated or normal
  * Pulse pressure: Normal or widened
  * Pulse oximetry: Normal to slightly low

* Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression (e.g., narcotics, sedatives)
  * Pulse: Slow (bradycardia)
  * Skin color: Pale or cyanotic
  * Skin temperature: Cool
  * Skin condition: Dry
  * Respiratory rate: Decreased (hypoventilation or apnea)
  * Capillary refill: May be delayed
  * Pupils: Constricted (miosis), nonreactive if severe, unequal if trauma/stroke
  * Blood pressure: May be low
  * Pulse pressure: Narrowed
  * Pulse oximetry: Decreased (< 94%), may be critically low with respiratory depression

* Perfusion Failure / Decompensated Shock
  * Pulse: Weak, thready, or absent; possible bradycardia
  * Skin color: Cyanotic or mottled
  * Skin temperature: Cold
  * Skin condition: Very moist or clammy
  * Respiratory rate: Slow, irregular, or agonal
  * Mental status: Altered, confused, or unresponsive
  * Capillary refill: Markedly delayed (>2 seconds)
  * Pupils: Dilated, nonreactive (brainstem failure or cardiac arrest)
  * Blood pressure: Severely low (SBP < 90 mmHg)
  * Pulse pressure: Narrowed or absent
  * Pulse oximetry: Critically low (often < 90%)

* Toxic States (e.g., drug overdose, poisoning)
  * Pulse: Variable (fast, slow, or irregular)
  * Skin color: Flushed, pale, or cyanotic
  * Skin temperature: Hot (anticholinergics) or cool (organophosphates)
  * Skin condition: Moist or dry
  * Respiratory rate: Increased (stimulants) or decreased (depressants)
  * Capillary refill: Variable
  * Pupils: Dilated (LSD, stimulants), constricted (opioids), unequal/nonreactive (toxins)
  * Blood pressure: Variable — ↑ with stimulants, ↓ with depressants
  * Pulse pressure: Variable
  * Pulse oximetry: Variable — may be low with respiratory depression or pulmonary effects

* Inflammatory States (e.g., liver disease, sepsis)
  * Pulse: Rapid (early infection) or slow (late liver failure)
  * Skin color: Jaundiced, flushed, or pale
  * Skin temperature: Hot (fever/sepsis) or normal
  * Skin condition: Dry or moist
  * Respiratory rate: Increased (due to inflammation, fever, acidosis)
  * Capillary refill: May be delayed
  * Pupils: Usually normal, nonreactive if brain hypoxia
  * Blood pressure: Early sepsis = normal/slightly low; Late = hypotensive
  * Pulse pressure: Early = normal; Late = narrowed
  * Pulse oximetry: Decreased in septic shock or liver failure-related hypoxia
