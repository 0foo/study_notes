# More detail

# A – Airway

## 1. Assessment

* Is the airway patent (open)?
* Listen for gurgling, snoring, or silence (signs of obstruction).
* Look for vomit, blood, secretions, or the tongue blocking the airway.

## 2. Interventions

* Manual maneuvers:
* Head-tilt/chin-lift (if no trauma suspected)
* Jaw-thrust (if trauma is suspected or cannot be ruled out)

* Suction:
* Use a rigid suction catheter (Yankauer) to clear the airway
* Especially important if patient vomited or has secretions

* Airway adjuncts:
* OPA (Oropharyngeal airway) for unresponsive patients without gag reflex
* NPA (Nasopharyngeal airway) if the patient has a gag reflex or clenching

* Goal: Establish and maintain a clear, open airway

# B – Breathing

## 1. Assessment

* Look for chest rise/fall
* Listen for breath sounds
* Count respiratory rate
* Feel for air movement
* Use pulse oximetry (if available)
* Note work of breathing (shallow, labored, absent)

## 2. Interventions

* Assist ventilations with a Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM):
* Deliver 1 breath every 5–6 seconds (10–12 breaths/min)
* Ensure tight seal, use EC-clamp grip
* Watch for adequate chest rise

* Administer high-flow oxygen:
* Use 15 L/min with oxygen reservoir attached to BVM

* If breathing resumes but remains slow, continue assisting
* Monitor for gastric distension (may need to decompress)

* Goal: Provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation

# C – Circulation

## 1. Assessment

* Check pulse (rate, rhythm, quality)
* Check skin: color, temperature, moisture
* Assess for signs of shock: hypotension, pale/cool/clammy skin, weak pulse
* Capillary refill time (if used in your region)
* Use BP cuff and monitor if available

## 2. Interventions

* IF NO PULSE → start high-quality CPR
* 30 compressions, 2 breaths, rate of 100–120 compressions/min
* Use AED as soon as available

* IF PULSE is present but bradycardic and patient is unstable:
* Paramedic: Atropine or external pacing per ACLS

* Establish IV or IO access (paramedic)
* Begin fluid resuscitation if signs of hypovolemia or shock

* Treat underlying causes:
* Naloxone for opioid overdose
* Consider trauma, sepsis, cardiac causes, electrolyte imbalances

* Goal: Support circulation and perfusion, identify and treat reversible causes

# Transport & Monitoring

* Rapid transport to hospital with early notification

* Continuous monitoring:
* Recheck vitals frequently
* Monitor LOC, pupils, airway status
* Prepare for deterioration (e.g., cardiac arrest)

* Document interventions and response
