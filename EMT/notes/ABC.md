### ABC

* airway
    * assess
        * obstruction(silence, gurgling, snoring)
        * scene?  drugs, blood, vomit, etc.
    * intervention
        * suction
            * 
        * adjunct?
            * OPA
                * measure from corner of mouth to angle of jaw
            * NPA
                * can be used on conscious or semi-conscious responsive patients with gag reflexes
                * it is often the preferred airway adjunct in such cases

            * supraglottic: 
                * if OPA isn't working after bagging for a while
                * iGel
                    * on side of iGel is kg weight to pick correct size
                    * 2.2 kg to pounds
                * king
                    * on side of the king: how much air to fill up, height, etc.
            
        * head tilt/ chin lift/ jaw thrust(if suspected spinal injury)-only if non responsive
        * put patient on side(recumbent) if aspirating
        * if patient is responsive and in mild distress-> have them sit up

* breathing
    * assess
        * respiratory rate
            * normal adult -> 12-20 bpm

        * pulse oximetry
        * observe breathing -> air movement, chest rise/fall
            * if breathing: irregular?, work of breathing/acessory muscles 

    * intervention
        * BVM -> 1 breath every 5-6 seconds
            * only use if breathing rate or depth is abnormal -> too low or too high
            * 15 LPM oxygen attached to BVM(thats 15 * 4% = 60% + 21% = 81% can continue up to 100%)
            * look for gastric distention
            * ensure proper seal with EC hand method and watch for chest rise
        * supraglottic 
            * 
        * NC or NRB -> if rate/depth is fine but low oxygyn via oximetry 
            * asthma, lung disease, emphysema->can breathe normally but not exchanging Oxygen correctly

* circulation
    * assess 
        * pulse 60-100bpm in adult
        * BP -> systolic
    * intervention
        * if no pulse -> CPR
        * if bradycardic -> monitor, atropine?, 60-100 bpm
        * other
            * if suspected overdose -> can give narcan(nalexone)
                * will not hurt if there's no overdose
            * if signs of hypovolemia or shock -> begin fluid resuscitation

### other
    * CPAP
        * no adjunct
        * patient alert
        * concious, breathing rate normal


* oxygen is 4% additional Oxygen per liter!!
    * normal oxygen is 21% so if you add 1liter that will be 4% increase to be 25% total

* excess oxygen can make heart attacks worse


* respiratory:
    * distress
        * increased work breathing but can still maintain ventilation
            * mental status intact
            * acessory muscle, tripod, nasal flaring, anxious, rapid breathing
        * failure(loss of mental function), 
            * mental status altered or semi-concious
            * cyanosis
            * fatigue
            * shallow, irregular breathing
        * arrest(unconsious)
            * no breathing at all(no chest rise or air movement)
            * unconcious/near death
            * 

* suction
    * Gently insert into the mouth (or nose/trachea)
    * Advance as far as needed (visible secretions, or until resistance/gag)
    * Cover suction vent (if present) and suction on the way out
    * Use a circular motion to clear as much as possible
