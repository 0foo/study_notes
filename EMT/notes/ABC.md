### ABC

* airway
    * assess
        * obstruction(silence, gurgling, snoring)
        * scene?  drugs, blood, vomit, etc.
        * level of 


    * intervention
        * if patient responsive and dyspnea
            * "SIT UP"
        * if patient unresponsive 
            * head tilt chin lift or jaw thrust (if trauma patient) immediately 
                * this will move the tongue out of the way
                * always do this for unresponsive because tongue will be blocking

        * if patient has an obstruction and is responsive
            * abdominal thrusts

        * patient has obstruction and unresponsive
            * if can see it -> finger sweep (don't finger sweep if can't see)
            * if can't see it -> do CPR EVEN if they have a pulse with foreign body obstruction
                * instead of ventilating look into airway to see if you can see the blockage, finger sweep

        * patient choking on fluids
            * use suction
                * 15 seconds
                * don't go past base of tongue
            * gurgling sounds 
        * if patient is aspirating
            * put in recovery position
                
        * child patients
            * padding under the shoulders to keep ear even with front of chest
        * child patient choking
            * 5 chest thrust, flip over, 5 back blows right between shoulder blades
        * adjunct?
            * OPA
                * measure from corner of mouth to angle of jaw
                * can't use on patients with gag reflex -> unresponsive patients
            * NPA
                * can be used on patients with gag reflexes
                * it is often the preferred airway adjunct in such cases
                * measure from tip of nose to earlobe

            * supraglottic: 
                * if OPA isn't working after bagging for a while
                * iGel
                    * on side of iGel is kg weight to pick correct size
                    * 2.2 kg to pounds
                * king
                    * on side of the king: how much air to fill up, height, etc.
                * LMA
                * 
            

* breathing
    * assess
        * respiratory rate
            * normal adult -> 12-20 bpm

        * pulse oximetry
        * observe breathing -> air movement, chest rise/fall
            * if breathing: irregular?, work of breathing/acessory muscles 

    * intervention
        * BVM -> 1 breath every 5-6 seconds
            * only use if breathing rate or depth is abnormal -> too low or too high
            * 15 LPM oxygen attached to BVM(thats 15 * 4% = 60% + 21% = 81% can continue up to 100%)
            * look for gastric distention to see if oxygen going into stomach
            * ensure proper seal with EC hand method and watch for chest rise

        * supraglottic 
            * 
        * NC or NRB -> if rate/depth is fine but low oxygyn via oximetry 
            * asthma, lung disease, emphysema->can breathe normally but not exchanging Oxygen correctly

* circulation
    * assess 
        * pulse 60-100bpm in adult
        * BP -> systolic
    * intervention
        * if no pulse -> CPR
        * if bradycardic -> monitor, atropine?, 60-100 bpm
        * other
            * if suspected overdose -> can give narcan(nalexone)
                * will not hurt if there's no overdose
            * if signs of hypovolemia or shock -> begin fluid resuscitation

### other
* better to over-oxygenate than under -> err on the side of too much oxygen

* devices to deliver oxygen
    * for patients with normal ventilation, don't need ventilation assistance
        * nasal cannula
            * mild hypoxia
            * Oxygen < 94% or COPD < 90%
            * cardiac and stroke patients
            * 1-6 LPM
        * non-rebreather
            * 8-15 LPM (typically just use 15)
            * obvious signs of distress 
            * severe hypoxiz

* CPAP
    * no adjunct
    * patient alert
    * concious, breathing rate normal


* oxygen is 4% additional Oxygen per liter!!
    * normal oxygen is 21% so if you add 1liter that will be 4% increase to be 25% total

* excess oxygen can make heart attacks worse


* respiratory:
    * distress
        * increased work breathing but can still maintain ventilation
        * mental status intact
        * acessory muscle, tripod, nasal flaring, anxious, rapid breathing
        * dyspnea, labored
        * treatment is Oxygen

    * failure(loss of mental function), 
        * mental status altered or semi-concious
        * cyanosis
        * fatigue
        * shallow, irregular, slow breathing
        * treatment is to ventilate and oxygen
        
    * arrest(unconsious)
        * no breathing at all(no chest rise or air movement)
        * unconcious/near death
        * 

* suction nethod
    * Gently insert into the mouth (or nose/trachea)
    * Advance as far as needed (visible secretions, or until resistance/gag)
    * Cover suction vent (if present) and suction on the way out
    * Use a circular motion to clear as much as possible

* airway sounds
    * upper airway
        * snoring -> tongue blocking airway
        * gurgling -> fluid blocking airway
        * stridor -> high pitched whistling sound caused by narrowing of upper airway
            * swelling-> allergic, etc
            * foriegn body obstruction but not all the way
    * lower airway (ascultation)
        * people ventilating just fine, but still hypoxic
        * wheezing 
            * bronchioles are constricted, spasms, swelling
            * asthma, anaphalxis, emphysema
            * treat -> oxygen, beta 2 agonist like albuterol to relax the bronchi
        * crackles(rales)
            * fluid is backed up! this causes capillaries are leaking 
            * Oxygen, CPAP, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin
            * acute respiratory distress, congestive heart failure
        * Ronchi
            * Pneumonia, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema
            * overproduction of mucus or infection
            * Oxygen, Beta agonist if protocols allow and wheezing is noted
