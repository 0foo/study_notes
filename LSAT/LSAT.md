* Necessary/Sufficient Condition Confusion
* Correlation/Causation Issues
* Confusing a "Could" for a "Must"
* Taking "absence of evidence" as "evidence of absence (of evidence)"

* affirm the consequent
    * X -> Y
    * assume X is true because Y is true




Universal negative 
* No economic system that is centrally planned can efficiently allocate resources,
* No cats are dogs

* this equivalence to  C -> not D
* or also: ∀x (C(x) → ¬D(x))


Universal Affirmative
* All birds have feathers.



* Necessary Condition
    * Definition: A condition must be true for something else to be true.
    * In logic, if X is necessary for Y, it means:
    * Y → X
    * "Oxygen is necessary for fire."
    * “You can’t have the outcome without it.”

* Sufficient Condition
    * Definition: A condition that, if it’s true, guarantees something else is true.
    * If X is true, then Y is true.
    * X → Y
    * “It’s enough to make the outcome happen.”
    * "Rain is sufficient to make the ground wet."
        * R = It rains
        * W = The ground is wet
        * Then: R → W
        * If it rains, the ground will definitely be wet. But the ground might still be wet even without rain (e.g., sprinklers), so rain isn’t necessary, just sufficient.


* if encounter a complex negative, can negate it and make it positive
    * no one who trades on insider information is unknown to every mutual fund manager
    * "Everyone who trades on insider info is known by at least one mutual fund manager."


* equivalence
    * 'some' -> at least one
    * 'none' -> not a single one
    * 'every' -> every one

* Positive Restatement
    * negate the noun and negate the verb
    * 'every' <-> 'none'
        * every bird does not fly
        * not a single bird flys
        * on noun
    * 'not every' 

    * on 
        * 'never' -> 'some'
    * prepositional phrase
        * 'all' -> 'some'

    * 'not every' is equivalent to 'some'/'at least one'
    * 'not a single'/'not some' is equivalent to 'every did not'
    * 'every' is changed to 'some'


* Important: be sure to translate 'body who X' to 'Xier'
    * nobody who studies -> no studier
    * everybody who dances -> every dancer

* unless 
    * means 'if not'
    * "A unless B"
    * "If not B, then A"
    * "not B → A" (the contrapositive of ¬B→A¬B→A).
    * "A or B"

* 'is such that', 'therefore'
    * conditional a -> b


* 'could'
    *  "Could" expresses possibility, not a definite if-then relationship like a true conditional.
    * A -possibly-> B

* 'have', 'has'
    * A has property b

* identify properties and causes


* hasty generalization
    * some/many have this property therefore this specific one has this property
    * in many cases the some may be implied
    * “Knowledge of trees can be gained from books → This book must provide that knowledge.”
    * “Some red butterflies are poisonous to birds that prey on them; so this particular red butterfly is poisonous to birds that prey on it.”
    * A Sufficient Assumption is the "Fix" for a Hasty Generalization
        * A hasty generalization is a flawed argument:
        * It makes a leap from some or can to must or specific without justification.
        * A sufficient assumption is what you would need to add to the argument to fix that leap and make it logically valid.
    * A Necessary Assumption
        * What’s one thing that must be true for this argument to even possibly work?
        * That A Room of One’s Own is the type of book that could provide empirical knowledge.
        * This doesn’t make the conclusion guaranteed (like a sufficient assumption), but if this weren’t true, the argument falls apart.
    * subtype of hasty generalization: Confusing Probability with Certainty
        * Overgeneralization Based on Statistical Likelihood
        * Takes a general statistical likelihood and applies it to an individual case without sufficient evidence.
        * "Skiers run a high risk of bone fracture; so it is likely that Lindsey, who has been an avid skier for many years, has suffered a broken bone at some point."

* instance of a Universal   
    * “Dierdre has seen every film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; so Dierdre must have seen Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, a film directed by Fassbinder.”

* Some red butterflies are poisonous to birds that prey on them.
    * There exists at least one x such that x is a red butterfly and x is poisonous to birds that prey on it.
    * some(x) (A(x) AND Y(x))


* universal negative
    “No mathematical proposition can be proven true by observation.”
    This is a universal negative:
    ∀x(M(x)→¬P(x))


* How to Negate a Conditional
    The rule:
        To negate a conditional A→B, you say:
        "A is true, but B is false."
        i.e. A∧¬B

* negating quantifiers
All A are B -> Some A are not B
No A are B -> Some A are B
Some A are B -> 	No A are B
Not all A are B	->	All A are B
